# Advent Of Code 2025

This is my code developed for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025). My code is written in Kotlin, and my primary goals are:

- have fun
- learn something new about Kotlin
- don't spend too much time

This code is available via [GitHub](https://github.com/nkiesel/AdventOfCode_2025) and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/nkiesel/AdventOfCode_2025).
